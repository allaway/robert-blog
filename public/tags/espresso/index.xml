      <description>An oft-mentioned shortcoming of the Gaggia Classic is the crappy steam knob. It&amp;rsquo;s not ergonomic, can break, and is just not that good looking (modified from image by Guy Sie](https://www.flickr.com/photos/guysie/14620900604)):
I was working on my Gaggia last week and cracked the knob trying to remove it. Instead of paying 20 bucks for a equally-crappy replacement, I decided I wanted to try and build a replacement. There are a few mods floating around out there, but they either don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to my aesthetics, or there are no instructions on replicating what they&amp;rsquo;ve done.</description>
