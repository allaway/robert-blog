  I was working on my Gaggia last week and cracked the knob trying to remove it. Instead of paying 20 bucks for a equally-crappy replacement, I decided I wanted to try and build a replacement. There are a few mods floating around out there, but they either don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to my aesthetics, or there are no instructions on replicating what they&amp;rsquo;ve done.</description>
