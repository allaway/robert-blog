  <h1> Mod your Gaggia Classic&#39;s Steam Knob </h1>

    <p>An oft-mentioned shortcoming of the Gaggia Classic is the crappy steam knob. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://coffeeforums.co.uk/topic/9360-gaggia-classic-steam-knob/">not ergonomic</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/b7rozs/steam_knob_steam_lever_mods_gaggia_classic/">can break</a>, and is just not that good looking (modified from image by Guy Sie](<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/guysie/14620900604)):">https://www.flickr.com/photos/guysie/14620900604)):</a></p>

<p>I was working on my Gaggia last week and cracked the knob trying to remove it. Instead of paying 20 bucks for a equally-crappy replacement, I decided I wanted to try and build a replacement. There are a few mods floating around out there, but they either don&rsquo;t appeal to my aesthetics, or there are no instructions on replicating what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>After looking at Gaggia parts diagrams, making some (somewhat) careful measurements, and spending more time browsing McMaster-Carr and many other similar parts sites than I care to admit, I came up with a solution that I thought would work. Specifically, I wanted to figure out something that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>most importantly</em>: fits snugly on the 4.6x6mm D-shaft that turns the steam valve</li>
<li>looks better than the stock knob</li>
<li>is grippier than the stock knob</li>
<li>is larger than the stock knob</li>
<li>has enough clearance from the chassis of the Gaggia so that it isn&rsquo;t annoying to turn</li>
<li>is wide enough to fill most of the hole in the side of the chassis</li>
<li>at least semi-heat insulated; the brass steam valve gets hot!</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turns out, the robotics hobby world has some 6mm D-shafts on motors, and they have lots of parts that follow consistent standards (and cross-standard adaptors), so I came up with a few different possibilities for prototyping a new knob. After settling on one, I crossed my fingers, and placed an order. Two days later, I received the parts and spent a few minutes putting them together. Thankfully, the final product turned out as way better than I could have hoped for a prototype:</p>

<p>I ended up buying all of the parts from ServoCity. I have no affiliation with them - I didn&rsquo;t even know they existed a week ago - but they seemed to be a reliable place to order from and they had everything I needed:</p>
