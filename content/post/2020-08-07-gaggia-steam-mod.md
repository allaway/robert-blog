An oft-mentioned shortcoming of the Gaggia Classic is the crappy steam knob. It's [not ergonomic](https://coffeeforums.co.uk/topic/9360-gaggia-classic-steam-knob/), [can break](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/b7rozs/steam_knob_steam_lever_mods_gaggia_classic/), and is just not that good looking:
